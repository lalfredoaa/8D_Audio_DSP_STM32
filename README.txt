Final project of Digital Signal Processing Laboratory (6th semester).

This project consisted on using FIR filters implemented in a STM32 microcontroller to filter audio and generate the illusion that the audio comes from different parts of the room (8D audio).

"SerialCom.m" is a MATLAB script used to send the original audio file to the microcontroller and received the filtered data (all via UART). 

"vueltacompleta.mat" is a MATLAB workspace that contains a sample of the filtered audio. 



I included the main source files but couldn't upload the whole (compiled) project due to Github restrictions.
